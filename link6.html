    <h1>WHY SHOULD YOU GET VACCINATED ? </h1>
    <h2><span class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></span> COVID-19 vaccination will help keep you from getting COVID-19</h2>
    <h2><span class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></span> Once you are fully vaccinated, you can start doing more</h2>
    <h2><span class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></span> COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody (immune system) response without having to experience sickness</h2>
    <h2><span class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></span> Wearing masks and staying 6 feet apart from others help reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others, but these measures are not enough. Vaccines will work with your immune system so it will be ready to fight the virus if you are exposed</h2>
    <h2><span class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></span> COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective</h2>
    <h2><span class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></span> None of the COVID-19 vaccines contain the live virus that causes COVID-19 so a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19</h2>
